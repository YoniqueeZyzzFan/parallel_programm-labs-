Info for files:
-  Data.txt              all values from two matrices
- Matrix.txt           result matrix
-  Result.txt           time for different matrices sizes
-  main.cpp             obviously
-  main.py              correctness check
###### Lab1: matrix product, and subsequent improvement in the form of parallel streams. Looking at file Result.txt we can say that the time directly depends on the size of the matrices, so for better time we can use parallel programming, which i'll use in next branches of this rep
